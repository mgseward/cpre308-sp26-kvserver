/*
 * bench_client.c -- Mini-KV concurrent benchmark client
 *
 * Project 2, CprE 3080, Spring 2026
 *
 * YOU write this file. The scaffolding here is intentionally minimal:
 * an argument parser and nothing else. Your job is to fill in the rest.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ./bench_client <host> <port> <num_clients> <ops_per_client> <read_pct>
 *
 * Requirements (from the spec):
 *   - Spawn <num_clients> threads.
 *   - Each thread opens its own TCP connection to <host>:<port>.
 *   - Each thread issues <ops_per_client> operations.
 *   - <read_pct> percent of ops are GETs; the rest are PUTs.
 *   - Keys drawn from a small pool (~1000 keys) so GETs actually hit.
 *   - Report total wall-clock time and overall throughput (ops/sec).
 *
 * Hints:
 *   - Use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) to measure elapsed time.
 *   - Each thread needs its own rand_r() seed to avoid serialization on
 *     the global rand() lock.
 *   - Read the server's reply line-by-line; don't assume one TCP packet
 *     per command.
